"""The :class:`Gtk.Application` subclass — wires everything together.

Principles & invariants
-----------------------
* :class:`NotesApplication` is the single point in the program that
  composes the layered architecture into a runnable system. It owns
  the :class:`Database`, the repositories, the :class:`AttachmentStore`,
  :class:`AppState`, and the controllers that the UI layer's editor
  and (future) buttons drive. Every other module receives those as
  parameters. No other module reaches for a global "the database" or
  "the app state" — composition flows top-down from here.
* :meth:`do_activate` is the only :class:`Gtk.Application` vfunc this
  class overrides. The application is registered as a
  :class:`Gio.ApplicationFlags.FLAGS_NONE` (single-instance) app; a
  second ``python -m notes_app`` while one is already running raises
  the existing window rather than opening a new one. That matches the
  design's single-window assumption.
* Long-lived resources (the :class:`Database`, the repositories,
  the :class:`AttachmentStore`, :class:`AppState`, the
  :class:`NoteController`) are initialised once on the first
  activation and reused on every subsequent activation. The
  migration runner is invoked exactly once per process lifetime;
  it is itself idempotent, but skipping the work avoids redundant
  version reads on activations past the first.
* The seeded welcome note is loaded by id (:data:`SEED_WELCOME_NOTE_ID`).
  If the user has deleted it, the application falls back to the most
  recently modified note in the library (:meth:`NoteRepositoryProtocol.list_all`
  is sorted by ``modified_at DESC``). If no notes exist at all, the
  selection stays ``None`` and the right pane renders empty — exactly
  the policy :class:`NoteView.refresh` already implements.
* Database errors during activation surface through
  :class:`sqlite3.DatabaseError`; we let them propagate. A failure to
  open the database is fatal for v1 (no data → nothing to show) and
  GTK 4 turns an unhandled exception in :meth:`do_activate` into a
  process-level crash with the original traceback. That is the right
  failure mode at this layer — better than swallowing the error and
  showing an empty window with no explanation.
* From build step 11 the :class:`AttachmentStore` is wired in for
  real: image attachments now flow end-to-end through the editor's
  Image button → :class:`Gtk.FileDialog` → :class:`NoteController.add_attachment`
  → :class:`AttachmentStore.add_for_note` → SQLite BLOB; and the
  rendered view's image-bytes resolver (built inside
  :class:`NoteView`) closes over the same store to fetch bytes by
  filename when an image macro is encountered. The step-10
  :class:`_PlaceholderAttachmentStore` is removed.
