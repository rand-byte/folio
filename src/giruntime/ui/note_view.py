"""The rendered-note pane: a fixed-width article column inside a scroller.

Principles & invariants
-----------------------
* :class:`NoteView` is the pane in which the user reads a note. It is
  stateless with respect to notes — every render rebuilds the buffer
  from scratch, driven by :class:`AppState`. The body it renders comes
  from the in-memory :class:`controllers.note_list_store.NoteListStore`
  (never a database read); images still resolve through
  :class:`AttachmentStoreProtocol`. It re-renders on
  ``notify::selected-note-id`` and on a store ``items-changed`` that
  touches the displayed note (an edit replaces that note's row).
* The pane's layout is the three-step stack from §2 of the plan:
  ``Gtk.ScrolledWindow`` (horizontal AUTOMATIC, vertical AUTOMATIC) →
  :class:`ArticleContainer` (a ``Gtk.Widget`` that also implements
  ``Gtk.Scrollable``, with a single child that enforces the fixed-width
  text column rule) → read-only ``Gtk.TextView`` populated by
  :class:`TextBufferRenderer`. Parse errors are shown *inside* this
  same surface — the buffer is cleared and an error notice rendered
  into it (see the parse-error bullet below) — so the pane is a single
  scroller with no extra strip above it. Because the
  container is a ``Gtk.Scrollable``, the scrolled window keeps it as its
  **direct** child and interposes **no** ``Gtk.Viewport`` (Option C of
  the plan); the bug that motivated this — no vertical scrollbar on
  first launch for an image-last note — came from a viewport committing
  a stale extent, so removing the viewport removes the bug.
* :class:`ArticleContainer` enforces the text-column rule and treats the
  two scroll axes differently because they have different owners.
  *Vertical* is pass-through: the container forwards the scrolled
  window's ``vadjustment`` / ``vscroll-policy`` to the (already
  scrollable) text view, which becomes the vertical scrollport and owns
  the v-extent — the widget that commits ``vadjustment.upper`` is the
  one that knows the height. *Horizontal* is container-owned: when
  allocated *wider* than the target column the slack becomes an
  equal-on-both-sides translation of the child, centring the column;
  when allocated *narrower* the container configures its own
  ``hadjustment`` (``upper`` = column width, ``page`` = viewport) and
  offsets the child by ``−hadjustment.value`` so the horizontal
  scrollbar pans the column. The column never shrinks, and the font
  never scales with window width (see §2 / decision 7 of the plan).
* ``Gtk.Box`` subclasses cannot override ``measure`` / ``size_allocate``
  in GTK 4 because ``Gtk.Box`` delegates to its ``BoxLayout`` layout
  manager — those vfuncs are invoked through the layout manager at the
  C level and a Python-level override on the box subclass is dead code.
  The only correct base for this widget is therefore ``Gtk.Widget``,
  with manual single-child management via :meth:`set_parent` /
  :meth:`unparent` and :meth:`Gtk.Widget.allocate` on the child.
  Because that parent link is owned manually, the container must also
  release it at teardown, or GTK finalizes the container with the child
  still parented and warns about leftover children. ``dispose`` — the
  natural hook in C — is not exposed for override by PyGObject, so the
  unparent runs from :meth:`ArticleContainer.do_unroot` (fired by GTK
  while a *rooted* tree is torn down, i.e. in production) with a
  :meth:`ArticleContainer.__del__` net for a container that is
  finalized without ever being rooted (i.e. the standalone widgets the
  unit tests build). Both funnel through one guarded
  :meth:`ArticleContainer._release_child`.
* The target column width is :data:`TARGET_CHARS_PER_LINE` ×
  *measured glyph width*. The measurement is injected as a callable so
  tests can stub it without needing a realised font, and so production
  can wire a closure that uses ``Gtk.Widget.create_pango_layout("M")``
  on the live :class:`Gtk.TextView`. The result is cached for the
  lifetime of the :class:`ArticleContainer` — font changes during a
  session would invalidate the cache, but v1 has no in-app font
  customisation so this is a non-issue.
* The four article margins (top / bottom / left / right) are derived
  from the same injected Pango measurements as the column width — both
  the M-width measurer (existing) and a sibling line-height measurer
  (new). Cached for the container's lifetime via the same
  ``_cached_..._px`` pattern. Top and bottom are :data:`ARTICLE_TOP_MARGIN_LINES`
  / :data:`ARTICLE_BOTTOM_MARGIN_LINES` multiplied by the measured line
  height; left and right are :data:`ARTICLE_INNER_HPADDING_CHARS`
  multiplied by the measured M-width.
* :class:`ArticleContainer` exposes three sizing getters:
  :meth:`text_column_width` (the 66-character text area, passed to the
  renderer for table / image layout), :meth:`outer_column_width` (the
  widget's actual width, including inner horizontal padding on both
  sides, used by :meth:`do_measure` and :meth:`do_size_allocate`), and
  :meth:`line_height_px` / :meth:`char_width_px` (the font-derived
  units the :class:`NoteView` reads when setting the four
  :class:`Gtk.TextView` margins).
* The four ``Gtk.TextView`` margins are set once at
  :meth:`NoteView.__init__`. They do not change on selection or on
  render — :meth:`NoteView.refresh` only rebuilds buffer contents, not
  chrome. (Same lifecycle invariant the rest of this docstring states
  for the widget tree.)
* The article's :class:`Gtk.TextView` is a private subclass
  :class:`_ArticleTextView` that paints tinted block backgrounds
  (admonition, blockquote, code block) at snapshot time. The
  paragraph tags from :mod:`ui.note_render.tag_table` deliberately
  carry only the *text position* (``accumulative-margin = True`` plus
  ``left-margin`` / ``right-margin`` = inset + one M-width); the
  matching tinted *wash* is painted by this subclass via
  :meth:`do_snapshot`. The wash extends one M-width beyond the text
  on each side, producing the visual "padded card" effect that
  ``paragraph-background-rgba`` cannot reproduce on its own — see
  :class:`ui.note_render.tag_table.WashSpec` for the per-tag
  parameters. The tag table is therefore built *after* M-width is
  measured (``char_width_px`` is required), and the wash-spec map
  passed to the subclass is keyed by :class:`Gtk.TextTag` objects
  (not names) so per-snapshot tag-lookup work stays O(1). The same
  subclass also paints the note *sheet* and its end edge: because the
  text view is the vertical scrollport, its own background would fill
  the whole viewport, so the view's CSS background is made transparent
  (the ``article-text-view`` class) and ``do_snapshot`` paints an
  opaque sheet from the top down to the end of the content plus the
  breathing part of the bottom margin, with a 1-px seam at the edge.
  Below that the view paints nothing, so the scroller's own background
  (the "desk") shows through and a short note ends visibly — using the
  parent's real background rather than an invented colour. The bottom
  margin is sized at :data:`ARTICLE_BOTTOM_MARGIN_LINES` +
  :data:`config.defaults.ARTICLE_END_GAP_LINES`: the sheet claims only
  the breathing lines, leaving the end-gap band as scrollable desk so a
  note taller than the viewport also ends at a visible edge when
  scrolled to the bottom (see
  :func:`ui.note_render.tag_table.build_note_end_wash`,
  :func:`_sheet_rect_for`, :func:`_seam_rect_for`, and
  :meth:`_ArticleTextView.set_end_gap_px`).
* The size-allocate vfunc — *not* the ``size-allocate`` signal, which is
  deprecated in GTK 4 — is the documented place to react to a fresh
  allocation. :meth:`ArticleContainer.do_size_allocate` configures the
  container-owned horizontal ``hadjustment`` and builds a translate-X
  :class:`Gsk.Transform` to position the single child, then calls
  :meth:`Gtk.Widget.allocate` on it with that transform. This avoids the
  re-layout cycle that writing ``margin-start`` / ``margin-end`` on
  ``self`` from inside ``size_allocate`` would trigger; it is the GTK 4
  idiom for "offset the single child by N pixels along X without
  rerunning the parent's layout". A horizontal scroll re-runs this vfunc
  via :meth:`Gtk.Widget.queue_allocate` (wired from the adjustment's
  ``value-changed``); re-``configure``-ing the adjustment to an unchanged
  value emits no further ``value-changed``, so there is no allocation
  loop.
* Image resolution flows through an :data:`ImageBytesResolver` built
  internally by :class:`NoteView` from an injected
  :class:`AttachmentStoreProtocol`. The resolver is a closure over
  ``self``: each call reads :attr:`_current_note_id` (set on every
  :meth:`refresh`) and asks the attachment store for the matching
  metadata-then-bytes. Tests that don't care about images can
  construct :class:`NoteView` with ``attachments=None`` — the
  fallback :func:`_placeholder_image_bytes` resolver is wired and
  every image renders as the renderer's small placeholder paintable
  (a grey rectangle that signals the missing image without aborting
  the document). Tests that *do* care wire a fake
  :class:`AttachmentStoreProtocol`.
* Filename-to-attachment lookup is intentionally O(N) per image
  (linear scan of the metadata list). For the v1 expectation of "a
  handful of images per note" this is dominated by the texture decode
  cost; introducing a per-note dict cache would add stale-cache
  hazards across edits (rename / delete attachment) for no measurable
  win. If the assumption breaks the cache lives at the resolver
  level — keyed by ``(note_id, filename)`` — and the renderer above
  stays untouched.
* The widget tree is constructed once at ``__init__``. :meth:`refresh`
  re-runs the parser and renderer against the currently selected note,
  but never reshapes the widget tree.
* **Parse-error handling.** When the parser raises, :meth:`refresh`
  clears the buffer and renders an in-surface *error notice* into it —
  a centred warning glyph, a headline, a user-facing message keyed by
  :class:`ParseErrorKind`, and a faint recovery hint — via
  :meth:`_insert_error_notice`. Selecting a note that doesn't parse
  therefore shows that notice in the reading column, *not* the previous
  note's stale render. The notice lives in the buffer (styled by the
  :data:`ui.note_render.tag_table.TagName.ERROR_NOTICE_*` tags), so
  there is no always-present banner widget reserving space above the
  pane when there is nothing to show: an error consumes the rendering
  surface only while it is being shown. :attr:`_error_message` mirrors
  the message currently on screen (``None`` when none), keeping the
  surface and that flag in lockstep — no "stale buffer + cleared flag"
  or "notice in buffer + ``None`` flag" state is produced here.
* The user-facing message table (:func:`_message_for`) lives in this
  module rather than as a method on :class:`ParseError` because the
  parser is pure and reusable; embedding UI copy in it would couple
  the parser to this UI's tone. The mapping is *exhaustive* over
  :class:`ParseErrorKind` so adding a new error kind forces an
  update here — caught by a unit test that iterates the enum.
* **Metadata line.** Directly under the rendered title the view
  inserts a dim-grey metadata line — ``Created <date>  ·  Modified
  <date>  ·  #tag …`` — as **plain text in the buffer**, carrying the
  :data:`ui.note_render.tag_table.TagName.METADATA` character tag. It
  is not a widget: there is no anchored child and no separate
  visibility toggle. The text is inserted by
  :meth:`NoteView._insert_metadata_after_title`, wired as the
  renderer's :data:`PostTitleHook`; the dates come from the
  :class:`Note` already fetched in :meth:`refresh` (stored on
  :attr:`_current_note` before the render so the hook can read it).
  A note with no tags shows only the two dates. A thin horizontal rule
  separating the metadata from the body is painted by
  :class:`_ArticleTextView` as the ``hairline`` wash for the metadata
  tag (see :func:`ui.note_render.tag_table.build_wash_specs`), so the
  whole rendered-view styling stays in the tag table / wash painter
  and introduces no child widget. Because the right pane is a
  :class:`Gtk.Stack` that hides the whole :class:`NoteView` in SOURCE
  mode (where the raw ``:tags:`` line is visible in the editor), the
  buffer-resident metadata needs no view-mode toggle.

# pylint: disable=too-many-lines
# This step pushed the file past pylint's default 1000-line ceiling
# because the snapshot-time wash painter (:class:`_ArticleTextView`)
# adds the new subclass, its rect-computation seam, and the wash-spec
# wiring inside :meth:`NoteView.__init__`. The new class is tightly
# coupled to the existing :class:`ArticleContainer` / :class:`NoteView`
# pair — they share the M-width measurement and the tag-table key
# translation — so extracting it to its own module would scatter the
# wiring without improving readability.

    """A :class:`Gtk.TextView` subclass that paints wider washes for tinted block paragraphs.

    The paragraph tags in :mod:`ui.note_render.tag_table`
    deliberately omit ``paragraph-background-rgba``; this subclass
    paints the matching wash itself via :meth:`do_snapshot`. For every
    visible logical line whose first iter carries a tag listed in the
    wash-spec map, it appends a :class:`Gsk.ColorNode` to the snapshot
    at a rect that extends one M-width beyond the text on each side,
    then delegates to :meth:`Gtk.TextView.do_snapshot` so inline text
    renders on top.

    The wash-spec map is supplied post-construction via
    :meth:`install_wash_specs`, keyed by :class:`Gtk.TextTag` objects
    (rather than tag names) so the per-snapshot lookup stays O(1) and
    avoids re-walking the tag table on every paint. Before
    :meth:`install_wash_specs` is called the painter is a no-op —
    that is the right behaviour for the brief window between
    constructor and wash-spec install, and the right fallback for
    test code that constructs the view without wiring the painter.

    Splitting :meth:`_compute_wash_rects` out of :meth:`do_snapshot`
    is the test seam: tests assert the list of rects directly without
    driving GTK's snapshot machinery.

    **The sheet, and the end-of-note edge.** The view's CSS background is
    transparent (set via the ``article-text-view`` style class, see
    ``css/app.css``); the page is instead painted here in
    :meth:`do_snapshot` as an opaque *sheet* from the top down to the end
    of the content (plus the breathing part of the bottom margin). Below
    the content the view paints nothing, so the scroller's own background
    (the "desk") shows through — that is what gives a short note a visible
    end, using the *parent's* real background rather than a separately-
    invented colour that could drift from the theme. A translucent 1-px
    *seam* is drawn at the sheet's bottom edge. The colours come from
    :func:`ui.note_render.tag_table.build_note_end_wash` (one place for
    every rendered-view colour) and the geometry is factored into the
    free functions :func:`_sheet_rect_for` / :func:`_seam_rect_for` so the
    rect math is unit-testable without a realised font. While a long note
    is scrolled so that content still extends past the viewport bottom the
    sheet fills the viewport and no seam is drawn; scrolled to its very
    end, the end-gap desk band reserved by :meth:`set_end_gap_px` brings
    the sheet bottom (and the seam) into view with desk beneath, so a long
    note ends as visibly as a short one. An empty buffer (the parse-error
    / no-note state) paints a full-height blank sheet.

    The container holds a single child (in production, the rendered-view
    :class:`Gtk.TextView`) and enforces the column-width rule from §2 of
    the plan. It implements :class:`Gtk.Scrollable` so the parent
    ``Gtk.ScrolledWindow`` keeps it as its **direct** child and interposes
    **no** ``Gtk.Viewport``. That is the structural fix from Option C of
    the plan: with no separate viewport, no other widget caches a stale
    vertical extent, so the rendered pane shows the correct vertical
    scrollbar on first launch even for a note whose last line is a
    static-size image.

    The two axes are treated differently because they have different
    owners:

    * **Vertical — pass-through.** The container forwards the scrolled
      window's :attr:`vadjustment` and :attr:`vscroll_policy` straight
      down to the (already scrollable) text view. The text view becomes
      the vertical scrollport: it owns the scroll extent and writes the
      correct ``vadjustment.upper`` as part of its own layout, exactly as
      it does when it is the direct child of a ``Gtk.ScrolledWindow``.
      The widget that commits the extent is now the widget that knows the
      height, so there is no separate viewport holding a stale value —
      this is what removes the bug. The forwarding is wired from the
      ``notify::vadjustment`` / ``notify::vscroll-policy`` handlers and
      re-applied in :meth:`set_child` (the child may be set before or
      after the scrolled window installs the adjustments).
    * **Horizontal — owned by the container.** The reading column has a
      fixed width that can exceed the viewport, and scrolling a fixed,
      centred column is a container-level translation, not something the
      text view can do by scrolling its own (wrapped-to-width) content.
      So the container keeps ownership of the :attr:`hadjustment`: in
      :meth:`do_size_allocate` it configures the adjustment
      (``upper = outer column width``, ``page_size = allocated width``,
      value clamped to ``column − viewport``), allocates the child at the
      full column width, and translates it horizontally — centring it
      when the viewport is wider than the column and offsetting it by
      ``−hadjustment.value`` when narrower. Its overflow is ``HIDDEN`` so
      the column is clipped to the viewport, and it re-allocates on the
      adjustment's ``value-changed`` so a horizontal scroll repositions
      the column.

    The four :class:`Gtk.Scrollable` properties (:attr:`hadjustment`,
    :attr:`vadjustment`, :attr:`hscroll_policy`, :attr:`vscroll_policy`)
    are the interface's required surface. They are plain data properties —
    GObject stores the value and emits ``notify`` — and the container
    reacts via its own ``notify::`` handlers rather than property setters,
    which keeps the two per-axis behaviours above cleanly separated.

    Why ``Gtk.Widget`` and not ``Gtk.Box``: in GTK 4, ``Gtk.Box`` uses a
    ``BoxLayout`` *layout manager*, and the widget-level
    :meth:`measure` / :meth:`size_allocate` vfuncs on ``Gtk.Box``
    delegate to that layout manager at the C level. A Python override
    of :meth:`do_measure` / :meth:`do_size_allocate` on a ``Gtk.Box``
    subclass is therefore dead code — never reached at runtime, even
    though calling those methods directly from Python (as a unit test
    might) appears to work. ``Gtk.Widget`` has no such indirection.

    Single-child management is manual: :meth:`set_child` replaces
    :meth:`Gtk.Box.append`; it unparents any prior child and parents
    the new one via :meth:`Gtk.Widget.set_parent`. The child shows up
    via :meth:`Gtk.Widget.get_first_child` exactly as under any other
    ``Gtk.Widget`` parent.

    Construction takes a :data:`CharWidthMeasurer` and a
    :data:`LineHeightMeasurer`. Each measurer is invoked exactly once
    across the container's lifetime — the result is cached and reused
    by all subsequent getter calls. Three width getters
    (:meth:`text_column_width`, :meth:`outer_column_width`,
    :meth:`char_width_px`) are derived from the M-width measurement;
    one (:meth:`line_height_px`) from the line-height measurement. The
    :class:`NoteView` owns the *outer* widget size (used by the two
    vfuncs) while the renderer is fed the *text* width — the inner
    horizontal padding sits between the two and is enforced by the
    :class:`Gtk.TextView`'s ``left-margin`` / ``right-margin``.
